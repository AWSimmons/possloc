@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="In any real experiment, due to noise it is likely that the table of observed data might look like a signalling data table. Valid notions of nonlocality and contextuality in this setting have been explored, for example by Dzafharov \protect \emph  {et al}\cite {Dzha2016}. However, in this paper we are dealing with possibilistic idealisations of data, and so we will ask that the tables obey a (possibilistic) no-signalling restriction exactly."}
